## A meeting room scheduling app

TrackMeet's initial goal was to come up with an alternative tool for scheduling studyrooms and meeting rooms at our local library. The system that the library had in place was rigid, and very limited in what it could do. We set out with the goal of coming up with a better system that would allow our users to have better search capabilities, be able to add and remove reservations, and recieve text reminders about their reservation.
